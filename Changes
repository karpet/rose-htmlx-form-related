Revision history for Rose-HTMLx-Form-Related

0.01    23 Aug 2008
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    23 Aug 2008
        * switch to schema->source from schema->class when introspecting
          DBIC components' relationships

0.03    23 Aug 2008
        * revert 0.02 change for DBIC to use both source() AND class() because
          of the way inheritance works in RDBOHelpers
        * added tests for all relationships

0.04    24 Aug 2008
        * problem in 0.02 and 0.03 was not source vs class but using each()
          on a hash ref. Might be that the internal iterator needed resetting.
          In any case, changing to keys() fixed issue with undef values.

0.05    25 Aug 2008
        * add app() method to RelInfo class and set it in discover_relationships()
        * added get_controller() to RelInfo
        * add missing prereqs to Makefile.PL
        * add missing docs
        * refactor DBIC get_objects() and get_objects_count() to actually work.

0.06    26 Aug 2008
        * set label for DBIC m2m to method name not rel_name

0.07    11 Sept 2008
        * support multicolumn PKs in DBIC::Metadata
        * do not re-make pop menus or autocomplete fields in interrelate_fields()
        * add foreign_column_for() method in RelInfo to support multi-col FKs
        * add interrelate_fields() boolean to Metadata to toggle on/off
        * skip interrelate_fields() if FK represents multiple columns
        * skip DBIC::Metadata->discover_relationships() if DBIC_DEPLOY_IN_PROGRESS
        * refactor DBIC::discover_relationships() to use ResultSource instead of ResultSet
        * catch edge case where no foreign class defined

0.08    12 Sept 2008
        * fix missing req in Makefile.PL

0.09    15 Oct 2008
        * add some more debugging to RDBO Metadata
        * add init_default_sort_by to Metadata base class

0.10    27 Oct 2008
        * calling $form->reset or $form->clear will now refetch objects from db for interrelated 
          menus, re-populating the options.

0.11    27 Oct 2008
        * fix dbic tests so they skip the correct number of tests

0.12    17 Nov 2008
        * support the new 'unqiue_value()' method in RDBOHelpers and MoreHelpers, which will now
          override show_related_field_using() when called in foreign_field_value().

0.13    24 Nov 2008
        * fix autocomplete bug to call get_controller() rather than simply controller()
        * add map_to_column, map_from_column and map_class_controller_class to RelInfo
        * add as_hash() to RelInfo

0.14    30 Dec 2008
        * allow for null value in generated menu fields
        * double check for controller in make autocomplete field
        * catch condition where the same field is used as both a FK and one side of a o2m relationship.
          prefer the FK.

0.15    10 Feb 2009
        * double check that $app is a ref() rather than a class name before setting in RelInfo
        * add missing docs that Class::XSAccessor (optional for Rose::Object) triggers for
          Pod::Coverage

0.16    27 Feb 2009
        * revert change in 0.15 with only setting $app if ref(). This caused tests in CatalystX::CRUD::YUI to fail.
