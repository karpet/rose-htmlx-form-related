 - revert change in 0.15 with only setting $app if ref(). This caused tests
   in CatalystX::CRUD::YUI to fail.
 - don't try converting non-text fields to autocomplete

 - double check that $app is a ref() rather than a class name before

   triggers for Pod::Coverage

0.14 2008-12-30
 - allow for null value in generated menu fields

 - add as_hash() to RelInfo

0.12 2008-11-17
 - support the new 'unqiue_value()' method in RDBOHelpers and MoreHelpers,
   which will now override show_related_field_using() when called in
   foreign_field_value().

0.11 2008-10-27
 - fix dbic tests so they skip the correct number of tests

0.10 2008-10-27
 - calling $form->reset or $form->clear will now refetch objects from db
   for interrelated  menus, re-populating the options.

0.09 2008-10-15
 - add some more debugging to RDBO Metadata
 - add init_default_sort_by to Metadata base class

0.08 2008-09-12
 - fix missing req in Makefile.PL

0.07 2008-09-11
 - support multicolumn PKs in DBIC::Metadata
 - do not re-make pop menus or autocomplete fields in interrelate_fields()
 - add foreign_column_for() method in RelInfo to support multi-col FKs
 - add interrelate_fields() boolean to Metadata to toggle on/off
 - skip interrelate_fields() if FK represents multiple columns
 - skip DBIC::Metadata->discover_relationships() if DBIC_DEPLOY_IN_PROGRESS
 - refactor DBIC::discover_relationships() to use ResultSource instead of
   ResultSet
 - catch edge case where no foreign class defined

0.06 2008-08-26
 - set label for DBIC m2m to method name not rel_name

0.05 2008-08-25
 - add app() method to RelInfo class and set it in discover_relationships()

0.04 2008-08-24
 - problem in 0.02 and 0.03 was not source vs class but using each() on a
   hash ref. Might be that the internal iterator needed resetting. In any
   case, changing to keys() fixed issue with undef values.

0.03 2008-08-23
 - revert 0.02 change for DBIC to use both source() AND class() because of
   the way inheritance works in RDBOHelpers
 - added tests for all relationships

0.02 2008-08-23

   components' relationships
