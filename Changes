Revision history for Rose-HTMLx-Form-Related

0.01    23 Aug 2008
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    23 Aug 2008
        * switch to schema->source from schema->class when introspecting
          DBIC components' relationships

0.03    23 Aug 2008
        * revert 0.02 change for DBIC to use both source() AND class() because
          of the way inheritance works in RDBOHelpers
        * added tests for all relationships

0.04    24 Aug 2008
        * problem in 0.02 and 0.03 was not source vs class but using each()
          on a hash ref. Might be that the internal iterator needed resetting.
          In any case, changing to keys() fixed issue with undef values.
